Sometimes it can be a small change like adding an extra meal along the itinerary.  Sometimes the change may result in us altering the tour for the coming year.  Ultimately, our goal is  to provide you with the most rewarding experience. Please note that our brochure is usually released in November each year. If you have booked from the previous brochure you may find there have been some changes to the itinerary.

INCA TRAIL AND MACHU PICCHU REGULATIONSThe rules and regulations controlling the Inca Trail and Machu Picchu are continually changing. Before embarking on your adventure to Peru it is very important that you familiarize yourself with the Inca Trail booking policies and guidelines as described in a document available on our website, at the following URL address:\n\nhttp://www.gadventures.com//terms-conditions/inca-trail-booking-policies/\n\n2. MACHU PICCHU BY TRAIN- OPTIONALPlease advise at time of booking if you do not wish to hike the Inca Trail. Instead, you will have 2 nights in Cusco, travel by train for a night in Aguas Calientes, and join the hikers for the tour of Machu Picchu.\n\n3. INCA TRAIL MAINTENANCEPortions of the Inca Trail will be closed for general maintenance during the month of February each year. Also, closures may occur at various times throughout the year due to inclement weather or other conditions beyond our control. During these periods, any tour affected will hike the Lares Trek.\n\n4. COMBO TRIPPlease note that this tour combines with other G Adventures tours. As such, the staff and some travel companions on your tour may have previously been traveling together with G Adventures, prior to Day 1 of your tour. Likewise, some staff and travel companions may be continuing together on another G Adventures tour, after your trip concludes.\n\n5. EXTRASLooking to add to your experience? Check out our Extras! Specially designed for travellers with unique interests, Extras are optional add-ons to your G adventures trip that make your adventure more you-centric. Extras must be booked prior to departure, please see details in our optional activities field and ask you sales GCO.\n\n6. In our continued effort to support the rights of the porters on the Inca Trail, we would like ensure that they never exceed the weight limit for their packs as set out by the Peruvian authorities. Porters are allowed to carry no more than 6kg of personal belongings per hiker (for all other Peru treks the limit is 8kg). That means that including your sleeping bag, toiletries, clothing, etc, you are allowed a total weight of 6kg for the hike which will be carried in a duffle bag provided by our local office. Any additional weight must then be carried by you in your day pack. To help achieve this goal we recommend that you carry travel sized toiletries, that you bring sport sandals that can be worn with socks (which are lighter than running/walking shoes) and that you limit electronics to those that you are willing to carry. Any additional baggage can be left in Cusco, but is advised that you bring anything of value (eg. money, passport, credit cards, camera, etc) with you on the trek.\n\nIf at the end of your trek you felt your trekking guide and support team did an outstanding job, tipping is appreciated. The amount is entirely a personal preference, however as a guideline, we suggest each hiker contributes the following to a collective pool. We suggest a tipping amount of $40 per person for the Inca Trail and $35 per person for the Lares Trek.\n\n7. All travellers are required to pay the tax on domestic flights in Peru. Foreign travellers are exempt form this, and proving you are indeed a foreign traveller can be done by providing us with your international ticket number (ITN). Travellers who do not submit international ticket numbers at least 30 days prior to Day 1 of their tour will be required to pay the domestic tax on all included flights.\n\n", "GROUP LEADER DESCRIPTION": "All G Adventures group trips are accompanied by one of our group leaders, a G Adventures representative, or an expedition team.

While not being guides in the traditional sense you can expect them to have a broad general knowledge of the countries visited on the trip, including historical, cultural, religious and social aspects.

Ultimately, our goal is  to provide you with the most rewarding experience. Please note that our brochure is usually released in November each year.

The itinerary is brief, as we never know exactly where our journey will take us. Due to our style of travel and the regions we visit, travel can be unpredictable.

We believe that helmets should be worn at all times, to ensure maximum protection while you are cycling. However, we are aware that some passengers may prefer to cycle without a helmet. If you choose to do so, this is entirely at your own risk.\n\nIf you would prefer to bring your own bike with you for this trip, or have some specific equipment that you would prefer to use then please advise us when you book. We recommend that you bring a hybrid or all terrain bike for this trip, with a minimum of 21 gears and suitable for riding along roads and on bike tracks. For this trip it would be best to have semi-slick tyres good for road and light off road use.\n\nBringing Your Own Bike\n\nIf you choose to bring your own bike, please be aware that you are responsible for the maintenance and support of the bike. It may be possible to hire some extra equipment as necessary for your cycle. Check with your airline about travelling with your bike, as some will charge you to take a bike on board. We would suggest that you pack your bike in a bike box or bag (usually available from your local bike shop). It's also advisable to make sure your bike has been serviced before you travel.\n\nPlease note, if you decide to bring your own bike, that there are considerations needed for local transport. Local trains have a limited amount of space, so taking a number of bikes can be difficult. Transport from the station in Chiusi to the hotel is small, and there is limited space on board. If there is not space, transport of the bikes to the accommodation may be at your own cost.\n\n1. It is important to note that in Europe, all guiding is based around local guides all of whom are licensed to work only in a particular city. As such, our leaders are able to provide orientation walks which will show you the layout of each town and city as well as the location of local services such as post offices and laundromats, but are unable to legally share historical facts and figures in public places. 2. In Europe it is very rare to find elevators in train stations, hotels or other public places. We use public transport on this trip, which means you will need to carry your luggage from platform to platform, in and out of trains and buses etc. and also possibly up several flights of stairs. You will also need to be able to stow your luggage safely on trains and buses. It is therefore essential that you pack light and bring luggage which is compact and lightweight, and which you can easily transport. The carrying of your luggage remains your responsibility at all times.\n\n", "GROUP LEADER DESCRIPTION": "This G Adventures group trip is accompanied by one of our group leaders. The aim of the group leader is to take the hassle out of your travels and to help you have the best trip possible. They will provide information on the places you are travelling through, offer suggestions for things to do and see, recommend great local eating venues and introduce you to our local friends.

A daypack is also essential for carrying everyday items. Space is limited on transportation, so there is a limit of one main piece of luggage per person. You will be responsible for carrying your own luggage. You must be prepared to carry your luggage up and down stairs, on and off transportation, and to hotels (max 15-20 mins.)\n\n", "VISAS REQUIREMENTS": "\u2022 Contact your local embassy or consulate for the most up-to-date visa requirements, or see your travel agent.

While we provide the following information in good faith, it is vital that you check yourself and understand that you are fully responsible for your own visa requirements.\n\n\u2022 All visitors to the EU (European Union) and EEC (European Economic Community) countries require a valid passport (with a minimum 6 months validity). USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand passport holders do not need a visa to visit the Schengen area (see below), however they may not stay longer than three months in any 6-month period.\n\n\u2022 For other nationalities, travelling in Europe has been simplified with the introduction of the Schengen visa. As a visitor to the Schengen area (Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, Finland, Italy, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Sweden, Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland) you will enjoy the many advantages of this unified visa system. Generally speaking with a Schengen visa, you may enter one Schengen country and travel freely throughout the Schengen region during the validity of your visa.  There are limited border controls at Schengen borders, if any at all.\n\n\u2022 Please note that the UK and Ireland are NOT part of the Schengen agreement.\n\n\u2022 A Schengen visa is applied for at the Embassy or Consulate of the Schengen country in which you will be spending the most nights on your trip to the Schengen space.

It may differ slightly to the one in the brochure. Occasionally our itineraries change as we make improvements that stem from past travellers, comments and our own research. Sometimes it can be a small change like adding an extra meal along the itinerary.  Sometimes the change may result in us altering the tour for the coming year.  Ultimately, our goal is  to provide you with the most rewarding experience. Please note that our brochure is usually released in November each year. If you have booked from the previous brochure you may find there have been some changes to the itinerary.

The itinerary is brief, as we never know exactly where our journey will take us. Due to our style of travel and the regions we visit, travel can be unpredictable. The Trip Details document is a general guide to the tour and region and any mention of specific destinations or wildlife is by no means a guarantee that they will be visited or encountered.
